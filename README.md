Oi! I'm Gustavo de Oliveira, a.k.a. lemomann. Pleased to meet you!

I'm a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina - UDESC - with a special interest in computational applications in engineering. Anything from algorithmic implementations of mathematical models to processing-intensive numerical simulations and embarked systems just absolutely charm me. I'm building this Github profile to showcase some of my personal projects. I can't waitto join a team to work on something complex and with real-world applications!

I'm currently working with professor Pablo Andrés Muñoz Rojas in his research on Computational Structural Optimisations. Right now I'm still studying some advanced topics on Continuum Mechanics, but soon I'll start working on the project's codebase, and it's all in FORTRAN. I couldn't be more excited :D

Here are my comms channels:
Discord: lemomann
Email: gustavo-daros@hotmail.com
And here through Github as well

Fun fact about myself: I produce music! Check me out at SoundCloud. It's not too good, though :p
